# Why?

Why is it so important to understand how streams work in Node js? The answer is simple: many built-in modules in Node js implement streams, such as `HTTP requests/responses`, `fs read/write`, `zlib`, `crypto`, `TCP sockets`, and others. You will also need streams, for example, when processing large files, when working with pictures. You may not write your own stream, but understanding how it works will make you a more competent developer.
