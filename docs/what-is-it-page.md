# What is it?

So, what is a stream. A stream is a concept that allows you to process data in small chunks, which allows you to use a small amount of RAM. Also, with its help, we can break the processing of each part into modules independent of each other (functions or classes). For example, we can immediately compress part of the data, then encrypt and write to a file. The main idea is not to work with the whole data, but to process part of the data one by one.
